# There are 7 types of operators:

# 1. Arithmetic operators

# 2. Assignment operators

# 3. Comparison operators

# 4. Logical operators

# 5. Identity operators

# 6. Membership operators

# 7. Bitwise operators
# ----------------------

# 1. Arithmetic operators:

"""
print("5 + 6 is", 5 + 6)
print("5 - 6 is", 5 - 6)
print("5 / 6 is", 5 / 6)
print("5 ** 6 is", 5 ** 6)
print("15 // 6 is", 15 // 6)

"""

# 2. Assignment operators:
"""
x = 5
print(x)
x += 7
print(x)
x -= 3
print(x)
x %=2
print(x)
"""

# 3. Comparison operators:
i = 5
"""
print(i == 5) #true
print(i <= 5) #true
print(i >= 5) #true
print(i != 5) #false (!= is not equal's symbol)
print(i > 5) #false
print(i < 5) #false
"""
# 4. Logical operators:
a = True
b = False
"""
print(a or b)# True prints (True>False)
print(a and b)# Both should have been true, SO it's False
print(a and a)# True
print(b and b)# False
"""
# 5. Identity operators:
"""
print(5 is not 5) # False
print(5 is 5) # True
print(5 is 6) # False
print(6 is not 5) # True
"""
# 6. Membership operators:
"""
list = [2, 4, 5.9, 38,7123897,333,12,69,6942]
print(69420 not in list) #True
print(69 in list) #True
print(69 not in list)#False
"""
# 7. Bitwise operators:
#Binary
"""
0 = 00
1 = 01
2 = 10
3 = 11
"""
"""
print(0 or 1)#binary of 1
print(1 | 3)# or = |
